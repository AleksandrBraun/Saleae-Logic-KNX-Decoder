  # KNX Decoder
  
## Getting started

1. Set up a connection to UART
2. Add the analyzer to this connection 

Typically communication between the control unit and the KNX controller is at 19200 baud, 8 data bits, EVEN parity bit and one stop bit.

In the settings, select the address depth:
2 / 3 levels addresses.
And decoder mode:
TX - data from device to bus
RX - data from bus to device
